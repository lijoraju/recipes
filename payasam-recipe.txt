INGREDIENTS:
1/4 cup of cheru payar / pasi paruppu / moong dal 
3/4 cup more or less of grated jaggery (or brown sugar, but itâ€™s a poor substitute) 
3 heaping tbsp of ghee 
10 plain, unsalted cashewnuts 
A few of raisins 
1 cup of thick coconut milk (onnaam paal) 
3-4 cups of thin coconut milk (rendaam paal) 
4-5 cardamom pods, crushed

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Roast the parippu in a dry pan until it turns golden brown.

2. Add the thin coconut milk (rendaam paal) and pressure cook for 5-6 whistles until mushy.
In hindsight, I probably should have left some whole dal in there too, for some texture.
I think I mashed it up too much.

3. Add some water to the grated jaggery and heat it on medium flame until it begins to melt. Stir well until the jaggery fully melts, strain, and mix in with the cooked dal.

4. Return the dal mixture to the fire, bring to boil and add the thick coconut milk. Heat through, add the crushed cardamom and remove from fire. Do not boil after adding the thick coconut milk.

5. Now, heat the ghee in a pan and add the cashew nuts and raisins. When the nuts turn golden brown and the raisins have puffed up, remove and add to the payasam. Mix well.

Notes:

1. I used canned coconut milk so I think it was thicker than I expected. My payasam turned out thicker than I am used to eating back home but it was still very tasty and I couldnâ€™t sense any difference in flavour.

2. Donâ€™t mush up the dal too much, leave some bits whole for some added texture.

Also, Happy Onam everyone ðŸ™‚
